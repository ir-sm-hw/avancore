Introduction of Ac_Model_Storage (aggregate of Ac_Model_Mapper) - incomplete

-   removed $ignore param from bind() since it's stupid, getBindIgnore() from Ac_Model_Object
-   removed _legacyLoad, _legacyDelete; simplified logic of both;
-   renamed _legacyStore to saveOwnRow();
-   store() is now alias of save();
-   Ac_Model_Object: 
    -   removed References feature (not used and ill-planned)
    -   removed _autoStore<...> methods - old gen'd code is not supported anymore
+   re-implementation of collection mechanism in Mapper-ModelObject pair
    -   Ac_Model_Mapper implements Ac_I_LifecycleAwareCollection
        (a descendant of Ac_I_ObjectsCollection)
    -   Ac_Model_Object implements Ac_I_CollectionAwareObject
    -   object can be registered in several collections
+   most storage-related functions are now handled by Ac_Model_Storage which is aggregate of Ac_Model_Mapper
-   Ac_Model_Mapper cleanup:
    -   removed storage-specific methods that were rarely used: locateRecord(), 
        indexCriterion(), getKeysCriterion()
+   Added first implementation of Storage object that should handle all storage-layer
    interaction for Mapper (an aggregate of Ac_Model_Mapper)
    -   Made sure that at least tests are passing after Storage introduction

-   Removed Ac_Model_Object::tracksPk(), Ac_Model_Object::tracksChanges() - both now return TRUE
-   Removed Ac_Model_Object::_pk, _origPk
-   Ac_Model_Object has public $_peIdentifier (for quicker access) that is popuplated by persistence
    methods. Only original value of peIdentifier is used as a primary key by persistence methods
